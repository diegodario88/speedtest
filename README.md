This runs a speed test and saves the history in .json files and an aggregate .csv
file.

This can be run on Linux for AMD64, ARMv7 and ARM64.

## Quick Start

You need to mount a volume to `/app/data`, and the files will be saved there.
Run it like this:

````bash
docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`/data:/app/data giggio/speedtest
````

After running will have a .json file with a date/time structure
(e.g. 202011212124.json) and a `speed.csv` file.

## Add a cron

To have a history a good idea is to add a cron job (with `crontab -e`) like
this:

````cron
0 */3 * * * docker run --rm -ti -v /path/to/my/data:/app/data -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro giggio/speedtest
````
